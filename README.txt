This is a classic React Frontend and Node Backend structure. If I have time before the deadline, I'd add Redux for better state management. (In fact, I am familiar with it!)

How to run...?
To run front end, execute cd client and then npm start
To run back end, execute cd server and then npm run dev

Personally, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Spring Boot. but I don't know Node.js at all.
So, I am very grateful to use this oppurtunity to learn Node, and complete a project based on it.

Here's several things to note about the code:
1. It might contain bugs.
2. I build the UI (mainly button styling) myself. I hate any template stylings like Material UI and Bootstrap.
3. All the logic processing are done in the backend, and backend calls the helper method.

I didn't really struggle too much on any single components. It's very fun building this app!

Yea, I noticed that from the beginning..."break"!
