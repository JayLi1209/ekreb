This is a word-guessing game, using React as Frontend and Node as backend!


## How to run...?
To run front end, execute cd client and then npm start
To run back end, execute cd server and then npm run dev


Here's several things to note about the code:
1. I build the UI (mainly button styling) myself. I hate any template stylings like Material UI and Bootstrap.
2. All the logic processing are done in the backend, and backend calls the helper method.
